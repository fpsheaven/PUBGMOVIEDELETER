# PUBGMOVIEDELETER


(WILL BE UPDATED)



A program i coded at 3am because i could not sleep ;)

Deletes the pubg movies so you dont have to everytime.

If it does not find the movies folder location on the  C drive,please just paste the directory of the movies folder since you installed PUBG on an other drive.

Run this when a new PUBG patch hits and it will just delete the movie files. 

Creates a text inside a folder on the C drive  for it to remember the directory if PUBG is on a different drive. Could make it work with a temp directory but many just clean the temp file anyway.
